Github Instructions:

test

-In the directory type:
	"git clone (link)"
-If cloned for the first time go into the file you just cloned and type:
	"git init"
-To compare to the version in GitHub type:
	"git status"

-Back to GitHub type:
	"       git add (filename)            "   OR   "   git add .     "
	"       git commit -m "message"       "
	"	git push		      "
-If github has file you don't have type:
        "       git restore (filename)        "   OR   "   git restore . "

-To update file:
	" git pull"

(WTF is the difference between "pull", "restore", "fetch", and "reset")


-To make git remember login credentials:
    $ git config --global credential.helper store


-To sync changes in the original into a fork:

    Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.
	
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git

    Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to main will be stored in a local branch, upstream/main.

    $ git fetch upstream

    Check out your fork's local main branch.

    $ git checkout main

    Merge the changes from upstream/main into your local main branch. This brings your fork's main branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

    $ git merge upstream/main

    Tip: Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository. To update your fork on GitHub, you must push your changes.
