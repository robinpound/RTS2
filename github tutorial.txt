Github Instructions:

-In the directory type:
	"git clone (link)"
-If cloned for the first time go into the file you just cloned and type:
	"git init"
-To compare to the version in GitHub type:
	"git status"

-Back to GitHub type:
	"       git add (filename)            "   OR   " git add .  "
	"       git commit -m "(message)"     "
	"	git push		      "
-If github has file you don't have type:
        " git restore ." OR "git restore (filename)"

-To update file:
	" git pull"

(WTF is the difference between "pull", "restore", "fetch", and "reset")

Forked.
Re-forked.
